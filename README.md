# Eye Exercise
This is an exercise to use JavaScript and CSS to create a dynamic web page with two eyes. Both eyes will follow the mouse movement simultaneously. 

It is one of the assignment in the MIT Professional Certificate in Coding program. The starter code for one eye moving was given. My task was to add another eye to the web page and make sure it was moving concurrently with the original eye.
