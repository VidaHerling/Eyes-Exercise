# Eye Exercise
This is an exercise to use JavaScript and CSS to create a dynamic web page with two eyes. Both eyes will follow the mouse movement simultaneously. 

It is one of the assignment in the MIT Professional Certificate in Coding program. The starter code for one eye moving was given. My task was to add another eye to the web page and make sure it was moving concurrently with the original eye. 

## How to Run
You may clone this repo to your local machine and make any modification as you like. Have fun! 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I plan to draw a complete face - adding a nose, a mouth, ears, hair and other feature - using CSS and create some facial expressions using JavaScript.
